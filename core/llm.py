"""LLM touchpoints — the translation layer only (PRD Principle 1).

Every AI call in the product lives in this file. Seven functions, each with a
deterministic fallback so the whole product runs with NO api key:

  QUERY TIME (per question)
    - classify_intent     : prompt -> costing | lookup | entitlement | policy
    - extract_department  : prompt -> which unit's contract
    - parse_intent        : prompt -> {subjects, hours, date}, normalized to the roster
    - answer_policy       : retrieved clauses -> a grounded answer (the only prose a user reads)
    - rank_documents      : query + catalog -> ranked candidates (fallback routing only)
  INGEST TIME (once per document)
    - tag_document        : document -> department / tags / summary
  PER SCENARIO (a known paystub, via /admin/draft_scenario)
    - draft_rules         : the paystub's few clauses -> PROPOSED rules + needs_data

None of these ever computes money — that is the deterministic engine's job, and no
module on the money path (engine, ruledsl, governance, ledger) imports this one.

OBSERVABILITY. Every call records itself to a per-request trail (see `record()`), which
the app drains into the ledger as `llm.call` events. This exists because the trail used
to log only what the model CONCLUDED — `{"intent": "costing"}` — and not whether a model
was involved at all. With an expired key the deterministic fallback answers and the
ledger looks identical, so the product could quietly stop using AI and nothing would say
so. For a system whose claim is "you can see how the AI reached its answer", *whether it
ran* is the first thing the record has to show.
