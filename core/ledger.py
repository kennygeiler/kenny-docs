"""Hash-chained, append-only audit ledger (PRD 5.6).

Every action in the system — a chat prompt, a retrieval decision, an intent parse,
a data read, a rule evaluation, a math step, a citation, an authoring approval —
appends one event here. Each event stores the hash of the prior event, so any edit
or deletion breaks the chain and is caught by `verify()`. This is the record that
must survive union/council/legal scrutiny.

TAMPER MODEL. A plain hash chain only proves internal consistency: an attacker with
disk access can rewrite event N and recompute every hash after it, or truncate the
tail, and the chain still verifies. Two mechanisms close that gap:

  1. HMAC. With KENNY_LEDGER_KEY set (a secret that must NOT live on the same volume
     as the ledger — it belongs in the platform's secret store), every event hash is
     HMAC-SHA256 under that key. Rewriting the chain now requires the key, and
     `verify()` refuses any event that was not keyed.
  2. Head anchoring. When keyed, every append emits `KENNY_LEDGER_HEAD seq=N hash=…`
     to stdout, so the platform's log retention holds an external record of the head.
     `verify_anchor(seq, hash)` checks a recorded head against the current file —
     a truncated tail no longer contains the anchored event and fails.

Without the key the ledger degrades to the old integrity-only chain (local dev).

Storage is append-only JSONL (one event per line). The scale roadmap (PRD §8)
swaps this for SQLite/Postgres behind the same append()/read()/verify() surface.
