"""Ingestion: PDF -> clauses (+ bounding boxes) -> catalog entry (PRD 5.1).

Real path uses docling to parse the PDF (OCR on, explicitly — see _converter) and read
layout provenance (page + bbox). Because docling is heavy (torch + model download),
ingestion can fall back to an OPTIONAL sidecar `<pdf>.clauses.json` — a generated
artifact, not committed to the repo — but only when the sidecar embeds the SHA-256 of
the exact PDF it was extracted from; an unbound sidecar is untrusted provenance and is
ignored. Either way we then tag + summarize the document (llm.tag_document) and write a
catalog entry carrying the source PDF's own SHA-256, which is what later lets the app
detect a swapped or edited source file.

    Digital pages report no ocr_score (docling leaves it NaN), so a born-digital
    document yields {} — which is what keeps confidence markings off documents whose
    text was never OCR'd. Non-docling tiers have no confidence to report and also
    return {}. Every clause from a page scoring below LOW_OCR_CONFIDENCE is stamped
    `low_confidence: True` so each downstream surface (X-ray, Compare, scorecard)
    can warn without re-deriving the threshold.

    Tiers, because a document that ingests as EMPTY is worse than one that ingests
    roughly: it looks fine in the catalog and is silently unanswerable.
      1. docling  — layout-aware: clauses, tables, real bounding boxes.
      1b. docling's `doc.texts` — the same parse, read directly, when the layout model
          writes a page off as a Picture (see _from_doc_texts). Still real bboxes.
      2. sidecar  — committed extraction (offline / docling unavailable).
      3. raw text — pypdfium2 page text. Coarse (page-level bbox) but never empty.

    Tier 3 is now the SCAN tier, not the table tier: a page with no text layer has
    nothing for 1b to recover. Table-only pages used to land here and lose their row
    citations, which is what 1b fixed.

    A MISSING file is not tier-3 material. Every tier here answers "we could not extract
    text from this PDF", and each one swallowed a nonexistent path into the same "empty"
    result — so ingesting a case.yaml that declares a document nobody has uploaded yet
    produced a catalogued document with zero clauses, indistinguishable from a scan. The
