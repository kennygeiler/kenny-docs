"""Rule DSL: schema, loading, and sandboxed expression evaluation.

Rules are pure data (JSON/YAML). Expressions inside rules are strings evaluated
in a restricted sandbox (simpleeval) over a flat namespace of "facts" — never
executable Python. This is what lets a new policy domain ship as data with no
new engine code (PRD 5.3).

Two rule kinds:
  - modifier: sets derived facts (e.g. bilingual +5% into `effective_base`)
  - selector: picks the formula, chosen by `priority` (highest matching wins)

A rule computes a TYPED VALUE, not necessarily money. An MOU is a rulebook and pay is
only one chapter of it: "5 days of bereavement (§11.3)", "15 calendar days to file a
grievance (§12.3)", "3.08 hours of vacation per pay period (Appendix C)" are equally
deterministic, citable rules. `result_type` says what the number MEANS, and the engine
is unit-agnostic — it evaluates the expression either way.
