"""Access control and abuse limits for a shared deployment (PRD §10).

Locally this file does nothing: with no passwords set, `install()` leaves the app open
so `uvicorn core.app:app` still just works. The moment the app is reachable from the
internet it needs four things it does not otherwise have:

  1. A password, because /admin can ratify rules and delete the document library.
  2. A SECOND password on /admin — ENFORCED per-path (TICKETS.md C1): "can ask
     questions" and "can decide what the contract means" are different jobs held by
     different people (PRD §2). The viewer credential opens chat and documents; only
     the admin credential opens /admin/*.
  3. A rate limit on /chat, because every prompt spends the operator's Anthropic
     budget, plus a throttle on FAILED logins (TICKETS.md C3) so the passwords can't
     be guessed online at full speed.
  4. An Origin check on state-changing requests (TICKETS.md C2): browsers attach
     cached Basic credentials to cross-site form POSTs, so without this a hostile page
     could replace a contract PDF via /admin/upload using the admin's own browser.

Set KENNY_REQUIRE_AUTH=1 (the Dockerfile does) and a deploy missing its passwords or
its ledger HMAC key fails at startup rather than silently serving the admin panel to
the world.
