## 1. System overview

One application, two surfaces, one spine. The architectural bet: **the AI is a translation layer,
never a decision layer.** It reads language into structured data; deterministic code selects the
governing contract, chooses the rules, and does every arithmetic step. Correctness is therefore a
property of the deterministic layer plus a human gate — not of the model.

### 1.1 Components

| Module | Responsibility | Why it is its own thing |
|---|---|---|
| `app.py` | HTTP routes, intent router, orchestration | one spine, handlers behind it |
| `llm.py` | **the only AI surface** — classify, parse, draft, tag, rank, compose | quarantine the model to one auditable file |
| `engine.py` | deterministic interpreter: differentials → base → premiums → rounding | the money path; imports no AI |
| `ruledsl.py` | rule schema, sandboxed expression evaluation, validation | rules are untrusted data by default |
| `governance.py` | (unit, date) → governing document(s); supersession | law selection is a fact, not a search |
| `ingest.py` | document → clauses + bounding boxes; title extraction; chunking | provenance is the product |
| `index.py` | `SearchBackend`: local hybrid (BM25 ⊕ embeddings), scale backend behind the same interface | swap retrieval without touching callers |
| `retriever.py` | catalog-level document routing (a fallback to governance) | — |
| `catalog.py` | per-document index: title, department, tags, summary, clauses | candidate identification |
| `caseio.py` | case bundle loader; the rule vocabulary (`known_facts`, values, scenarios) | one source of truth for what a rule may reference |
| `dataadapter.py` | `DataSource`: CSV today, DB/API behind the same interface | classification-table source is swappable |
| `ledger.py` | hash-chained append-only event log + `verify()`; events HMAC-signed under `KENNY_LEDGER_KEY` (kept off-volume) with the head hash anchored to platform logs | tamper-evident audit — rewrite needs the key, truncation fails the anchored head |
| `audit.py` | per-query trail assembly; frozen answer snapshots | an answer stays reproducible after the contract renews |
| `pdfview.py` | render a page and overlay the citation box | citations you can *see* |
| `auth.py` | two-role auth, per-IP rate limit, refuse-to-start-misconfigured | a shared link must not hand out the approval gate |

The corpus, classification table, rules and known answers live in `cases/<name>/`. The
engine, rule DSL, governance and ledger in `core/` are case-agnostic (`CASE=<dir>` points
the app at another bundle); the demo surfaces are not yet — example prompts in
`chat.html`, tour targets in `tour.js` and department cue words in `llm.py` are Santa
Cruz-specific, and `caseio.default_case_dir` falls back to `cases/santacruz`.

### 1.2 The seams that keep the roadmap cheap

Each is an interface with a working implementation and a documented alternative:
`SearchBackend` (local ↔ cluster), `DataSource` (CSV ↔ HRIS), and **the AI boundary itself** — every
`llm.*` function has a deterministic fallback, which makes the test suite hermetic and proves the
model is not load-bearing.

---

## 2. The AI boundary

Every AI call is one of seven functions in `llm.py`. None computes money; none decides which contract
or rule applies. They exchange **structured JSON** with the deterministic core.

| Function | When | Emits | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `classify_intent` | per question | costing \| lookup \| entitlement \| policy | keyword router |
| `extract_department` | per question | which unit's contract | cue match |
| `parse_intent` | per question | `{subjects, hours, date}`, resolved to classification labels | regex + name match |
| `answer_policy` | per question | prose composed **only from retrieved clauses** | quote top passage |
| `rank_documents` | routing fallback | ranked candidate documents | catalog scan |
| `tag_document` | per ingest | department, tags, summary | heuristic tags |
| `draft_rules` | per scenario | proposed rules + data-gap report | offline stub |

**Observability.** Every call records itself to a per-request trail (`llm.record()`, a `contextvars`
context so concurrent requests don't cross) that the app drains into the ledger as `llm.call` events:
which function, `claude | fallback | error`, model, latency. This answers a question the rest of the
trail cannot — *did a model run at all?* — because with a fallback behind every call, an absent model
is invisible unless recorded. The chat drawer surfaces it: an answer states whether AI was used and
where, so a reader can confirm no figure came from a model.

---

## 3. Domain model & governance

- **Subjects** are **classifications**, never named people: an attribute bag (`bargaining_unit`,
  rank, step, shift, certifications, base rate) keyed by a classification label (PRD §6a). The
  engine never depends on identity — a subject is the set of facts a rule keys on. Every computed
  amount is **per member** of the classification; multiplying by a staffing count is deliberately
  left to the reader (headcount churns weekly and lives in the HR system). Payroll reconciliation
  against real individuals is a separate audit mode, not the costing path.
- **Documents** declare `doc_type` (`MOU | amendment | salary-schedule | policy`), `bargaining_unit`,
  and `effective_start/end`.
- **Rules** belong to a document version; ids are namespaced `doc_id:rule_id`.

```
subject (classification):
  { "classification": "Firefighter/Paramedic (56 hr, top step)",
    "bargaining_unit": "firefighters-local-3535", "department": "fire",
    "rank": "Firefighter/Paramedic", "base_hourly": 53.40, "shift": "56-hour" }
```

The table that feeds this is `class × step × shift × certs × rate` — a position table HR already
maintains, ingested through the `DataSource` interface. A question resolves to classifications
**deterministically, by attribute filter**: *"the graveyard police classifications"* is
`shift = Graveyard AND department = police` over the table (exact label mentions win outright;
described attributes constrain AND-across-fields, OR-within-a-field). The model may propose labels,
but only labels that exist in the table survive normalization.

*"Which rules govern this subject on this date"* is a **deterministic lookup**, not a search:

```python
governance.resolve(units, date_iso, sources) -> GovResult(doc_ids, resolved, reason)
governance.apply_supersession(rules, sources, doc_ids) -> (kept, dropped)
```

Governance resolves two orthogonal axes. **Date** decides which document *versions* apply (a salary
schedule effective this year, a side letter effective mid-term). **Specificity** decides which of two
applicable rules *wins*: a `scope_rank` derived from `doc_type` — `statute < policy < MOU < amendment`
— so the more specific document overrides the more general (lex specialis). *Everyone is off on the
holiday, except police assigned to a shift* resolves because the police MOU outranks the citywide
policy — no tuned number, a fact about document authority.

**Supersession:** an amendment declares what it replaces (`supersedes: {doc_id, clauses}`); the
superseded base rules are dropped before the engine runs, but only when a live replacement exists — an
un-approved amendment must not silently delete the rule it was meant to update.

---

## 4. The rule model

A rule is **data interpreted by one generic engine** — never code. New pay math is authored and
verified, not programmed.

```json
{ "id": "doc:graveyard_differential",
  "role": "differential",          // base | differential | premium | exception  (§4.1)
  "result_type": "currency",       // currency | days | hours | date | boolean
  "pay_basis": "hourly",           // hourly | per_shift | per_pay_period | monthly | annual | one_time
  "when": "subject_shift == 'Graveyard'",
  "set":  {"effective_base": "effective_base * 1.055"},   // differential adjusts a fact
  "compute": "effective_base * 2.5 * hours",              // base/premium yields an amount
  "citation": {"doc_id": "...", "clause": "6.1", "page": 8, "bbox": [x0,y0,x1,y1]},
  "status": "ratified", "approver": "analyst" }
```

- **Expressions are sandboxed strings** (`simpleeval`) over declared facts — data, not executable code.
- **`result_type`** says what the number *means*; the engine is unit-agnostic, so one machine returns
  `$4,430.40` or `5 days`. Only rules of the question's type compete.
- **`status` defaults to `proposed`.** Only `ratified` + a real approver loads into the engine.
- **`scope_rank` and precedence are derived, not authored.** The drafter never emits a priority number;
  it cannot see the other documents, so it cannot rank against them.

### 4.1 Composition — pay is a stack, not a contest

The engine composes rules by **role** rather than picking one winner, because compensation is
additive and layered:

| role | mechanic | how many fire | ordered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `differential` | `set` — adjusts `effective_base` | all matching | authored order (they accumulate) |
| `base` | `compute` — the pay formula | **exactly one** (most specific) | scope, then priority |
| `premium` | `compute` — an added amount | all matching, **summed** | authored order |
| `exception` | suppress / cap another term | 🔷 designed | — |

```
line_total = base(chosen) + Σ premiums          after differentials adjust the facts
                                                (per MEMBER of the classification — no
                                                 headcount multiply; that is the reader's)
```

Roles are what stop a $250 stipend or a court-time rule from *winning* an eight-hour holiday shift: a
premium is not a base candidate, it adds. A percentage *of the base rate* is a differential (it
compounds through later multipliers); a flat add-on is a premium.

### 4.2 Pay basis — the right unit for the question

A single-shift cost includes only `hourly` and `per_shift` terms. An annual uniform allowance, a
monthly medical contribution, a year of life insurance are real money in the **wrong unit** for
*"what does this shift cost?"* — the engine filters them out by `pay_basis` rather than adding a year
of benefits to one shift. A different question (annual compensation) passes a different basis scope.

### 4.3 Attributes — how a generic rule reaches a specific person

A rule keys on facts (`subject_shift`, `subject_bilingual`, `event`). A fact is **looked up** (the classification table),
**stated** (the question), or **asked for** — never invented. A clause that pays for something the data
cannot identify (a detective-bureau premium with no assignment field, court time with no event fact) is
**not drafted** — it is reported as a data gap naming the missing field. Broadening it to fire on
everyone is the one thing the drafter must never do.

---

## 5. Flows

### 5.1 Ingest — extract and index, draft nothing

```
document ─docling─▶ clauses + page + bbox ─▶ chunk ─▶ SearchBackend.index()
                          ├─▶ extract_title  (from the cover, not a filename)
                          ├─▶ tag_document   (department, tags, summary)
                          └─▶ catalog.upsert
```

Ingest makes a document **searchable** — policy Q&A and lookup work immediately — and drafts **zero**
rules. Rules are authored per scenario (§5.2). This is deliberate: modeling a whole contract up front
produces hundreds of unverified rules; modeling per known-answer produces a handful, each provable.

Parsing degrades in tiers so a document is never silently empty: layout-aware extraction with real
bounding boxes; a fallback for table-only pages the layout model misreads as images; and a raw-text
tier (page-level citations) for scans. A declared document with no file is a hard error, not an empty
catalog entry.

### 5.2 Author rules for a scenario

A **scenario** is a known answer — a paystub, or an analyst's hand-computed figure (the four shipped
are the latter) — carrying the
people, the inputs, the expected amount, and a `branch_query` naming the pay it exercises.

```
scenario ─▶ governance.resolve → governing doc(s)
         ─▶ retrieve only the clauses the branch_query matches   (a handful, not the whole contract)
         ─▶ exclude clauses that already have a live rule        (draft only the gap)
         ─▶ draft_rules over just those clauses
         ─▶ verify the drafts reproduce the known amount
         ─▶ queue the few rules for human review, tagged to the scenario
```

Because the drafting task is small and focused, the model gets roles, units, and compounding right
where a whole-contract task is fragile. Clauses that surface but aren't the scenario's type, or that
the drafter refuses (event pay with no fact), don't become rules — they are answered by policy Q&A or
reported as data gaps.

### 5.3 Answer a question at run time

```
prompt ─▶ classify_intent
  ├ policy / lookup ─▶ retrieve within the governing docs ─▶ answer_policy (from retrieved text only)
  └ costing / entitlement ─▶ parse_intent ─▶ classification join ─▶ governance.resolve
                          ─▶ load RATIFIED rules ──(none)──▶ refuse, with a reason
                          ─▶ engine.calculate ─▶ enrich citations ─▶ snapshot ─▶ cited answer
```

`parse_intent` normalizes loose values to the data's exact vocabulary (`"Saturday"` → `Sat`) and
resolves class descriptions to classification labels by deterministic attribute filter (§3);
otherwise exact matching fails silently. A costing question with
no approved rule **refuses** — it never guesses a number.

### 5.4 Retrieval — a three-layer funnel

Each layer is cheaper and more certain than the next.

```
1  GOVERNANCE (deterministic)  who + date → the ONE governing document version
2  METADATA SHORTLIST          department → that unit's docs + citywide policies
3  HYBRID SEARCH               BM25 (exact tokens: §, $, a classification) ⊕ embeddings (paraphrase)
                               fused by reciprocal-rank fusion → clauses with doc · clause · page · bbox
```

Governance is a fact and the only layer allowed to decide a costing answer. Semantic search is the
last and weakest layer, ranking clauses *inside* a set the deterministic layers already narrowed.
Pure semantic search is wrong for contracts — answers hinge on exact tokens (`§9.2`, `$150`, a
classification name) — so retrieval is **hybrid by requirement**, and there is no vector database
until corpus size demands one.

### 5.5 Audit

Every action appends a `{seq, ts, actor, type, payload, prev_hash, hash}` event; `verify()` walks the
chain and detects any edit or deletion. Answer **snapshots** freeze the rule versions used, so a past
answer stays reproducible after the contract renews. Export hands the verified chain to council,
union, or legal.

---

## 6. Verification & the approval gate

Verification is the heart of the trust model. It has three states, and `fail` means exactly one thing.

| status | meaning | blocks approval? |
|---|---|---|
| `pass` | the rules reproduce the known answer | — |
| `fail` | **authored** rules disagree with the known answer | **yes** |
| `pending` | not fully authored: no rule covers the scenario yet, *or* a governing document contributes none | no |

The distinction is load-bearing. A number computed from an *incomplete* library (an amendment whose
replacement rule nobody drafted yet) is *not-yet-authored*, not *wrong* — treating it as failure would
train reviewers to ignore red. Only authored-rules-disagree blocks.

**Approval is a coverage-and-regression gate** (`_gate_verdict`, used by `admin_ratify`), not a
completeness demand. It compares scenario status before and after the approval, over the live library
**merged by id** with the selection, and refuses the whole selection when any of five rules trips:
R1 a known answer comes out wrong that did not before; R2 a known answer that reproduced would no
longer be answered; R3 the scenario a draft was made for does not pass; R4 a selected rule fires in no
passing known answer; R5 a live rule outside the selection that was proven before would be proven by
nothing. Scenarios no unit has authored yet stay pending and never block. This makes incremental,
scenario-by-scenario authoring work where a "every scenario must pass on every approval" gate would
deadlock, while a rule nothing proves can never go live. Each rule is proved at its known answer's
inputs only; *Try to break it* (`/admin/try_break`) mutates a rule in memory and shows which
deliberate errors the known answers catch. A **release gate** (`prepare_deploy`)
is stricter — it refuses to build a deployable image whose known answers do not all pass, so a
half-authored state cannot ship as a product.

**At scale**, a scenario is not a single paystub but the payroll export — every paycheck, per person.
Verification becomes per-paycheck reconciliation across the real input distribution; coverage is the
fraction of real payroll reproduced. The engine already computes per-person amounts, so this is an
extension of the scenario format (expected *per person*, not one total), not a redesign. 🔷

---

## 7. Error handling

The governing principle: **degrade loudly, refuse rather than guess, never let a failure look like a
success.** The categories are handled deliberately differently:

| Category | Example | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Missing input | a declared document with no file | **hard error**, named |
| Degraded input | a scan with no text layer | fall a tier, warn, page-level citation |
| Insufficient authority | no approved rule for a cost | **refuse with a reason and a next action** |
| Unresolvable | no date; evidence spans units | **ask** — never pick |
| Unsatisfiable | pay for an event no classification attribute can confirm | refuse and explain — it appears under Declined-to-model |
| AI unavailable | no key, or a model error | deterministic fallback, **recorded** as such |

A silent fallback is the most dangerous handler in the system — an `except: pass` around a model call
is indistinguishable from success. Every fallback records that it fired; "no exception" is not
evidence of a result.

---

## 8. Storage & scale

**Today: files, no database.** A case is a directory: PDFs, extracted `catalog.json`, the search
index, rule libraries (proposed + ratified), and the `ledger.jsonl`. This is a decision, not debt —
**rules in version control are diffable**, so "who changed this differential, when, against which
clause" is answered by the history itself, which a rules table gives up.

Each store has a different scale destination, reached at a different trigger:

| Store | Today | At scale | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Documents | disk / image | object storage, signed URLs | more than one machine |
| Extraction | `catalog.json` | relational DB (document → version → clause) | re-ingesting to fix one field stops being cheap |
| Search index | JSONL | cluster backend (same interface) | ~10⁴ chunks |
| Rules | JSON in git | **JSON in git** | never — the history is the point |
| Ledger | `ledger.jsonl` | append-only DB | concurrent writers on more than one machine |

The **ledger is the one store with a genuine database-shaped problem** and the only one whose loss is
unrecoverable — documents re-fetch, the index re-derives, but the record of who decided what cannot be
reconstructed. It is the first migration when a jurisdiction outgrows a single machine.

---

## 9. Security & deployment

A local run and a shared link are different products. On any shared deploy:

- **Two-role auth, enforced per-path.** *Asking* and *deciding what the contract means* are
  different jobs; the viewer credential reaches Chat and the documents it cites, and only the
  admin credential reaches `/admin/*` (ratify, upload, ingest, ledger). The app **refuses to
  start** misconfigured — including a missing ledger HMAC key — so a silent security failure
  becomes a loud startup failure.
- **Per-client rate limit** on the chat endpoint (real client IP via `Fly-Client-IP` on Fly) —
  one loop must not drain the model budget — plus exponential backoff on failed logins and an
  Origin check that refuses cross-site state-changing requests (CSRF).
- **Source integrity.** Every ingested PDF's SHA-256 is recorded; serving, costing, and ratified
  citations verify against it, and a re-ingest that moves or changes cited evidence marks the
  dependent rules stale until a human re-verifies them.
- **Path-safe document serving.** A `doc_id` from a URL is resolved through the manifest and confined
  to the case directory; it is never joined into a filesystem path.
- **Sandboxed rule expressions.** Rules are authored by a model and never executed as code.
- **Secrets stay out of the image.** Set out of band, never baked into a layer.
- **Single writer.** The ledger's file lock and the in-process job registry assume one writer; the
  deploy pins one machine until the ledger moves to a database.

The corpus, models, and approved rules are baked at build time; the ledger lives on a persistent
volume so approvals and the audit trail survive redeploys. **Basic auth is not identity** — it
separates roles but cannot attribute an approval to a named person; SSO + per-user attribution is the
gap between a demo and a system a jurisdiction runs on, and *who approved this rule* is a question a
union asks.

---

## 10. Onboarding checklist (any jurisdiction)

1. **Declare each document's governance** — unit and effective dates. The one thing no machine
   extracts. Verify two people on dates spanning an amendment resolve to different documents.
2. **Ingest.** Assert every document parsed with real citations, and clause counts are plausible.
   Policy Q&A works now.
3. **Map the classification table** to the baseline attribute vocabulary; case-sensitive values must
   match the data exactly. No employee names — classifications only (PRD §6a).
4. **Provide known answers** (paystubs). Per scenario, draft → review → approve, watching that
   approving one unit's rules never breaks another's passing scenario.
5. **Ask**, and confirm an unsatisfiable question refuses rather than guesses.

**The deployed corpus is real:** the Central Fire District of Santa Cruz County's published MOUs
(scans → OCR → docling, ~1,860 clauses) and master salary schedule. Its six known answers are
analyst-derived from the documents themselves (1.5× overtime × the schedule's real rate = $640.80;
$656.82 with 12 years' longevity; three bereavement shifts per Article XIV for a Firefighter/Paramedic
and for a Battalion Chief; 40 hours under the Chief Officers MOU; $716.16 under the Admin Group MOU)
— the PRD's explicit fallback until the district supplies real payroll. The guided test path for
reviewers is PRD §12. The engine and ledger in `core/` are case-agnostic; the demo surfaces still
carry Santa Cruz prompts and cue words (§1.1).
