"""Bake a case's corpus into the image at BUILD time, so the container starts answering.

Ingesting the corpus takes minutes (docling parses each PDF) and
downloads model weights on first use. Doing that at container start means the first
visitor to the shared link waits several minutes, every redeploy repeats it, and a
platform health check kills the instance before it finishes. So it runs once, here, in
`docker build`, and the resulting catalog + search index ship inside the image.

Deliberately runs with NO api key: ingest only extracts + indexes (rules are authored
per scenario at runtime and ship in rules_ratified.json as approved), so the build is
reproducible, spends no money, and bakes no key into a layer.

Usage:  python -m scripts.prepare_deploy cases/santacruz
